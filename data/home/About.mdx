I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by Prof. Changhee Jung. 
My research focuses on computer architecture, with an emphasis on designing reliable, lightweight processors 
to address crash consistency issues arising from power interruptions. 
Additionally, I am working on low-power design for intermittent processors 
by revisiting and customizing existing architectural approaches. 
I have tried to optimize some existing techniques for intermittent processors so that they can be more efficient.
